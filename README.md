To run our system, run these commands in a command window with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "git download page") installed. You also need [npm and node](https://nodejs.org/en/ "npm and node"). We have used node 13 for our project, and recommend you use the same. 

`git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/williaj/harmoni-team-7.git`

`cd harmoni-team-7/application/server`
 
`npm install`

This will take some time.

`npm start`

This will start the server running on port 8080 on localhost of your machine.

`cd ../client`

`npm install`

`npm start` 

Your development server will now start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000 "Your local machine").

And that's it! If you have any questions or bugs, please feel free to contact us.
