"Harmoni" is a web application for creating and organizing events. You can keep track of events, and artist, crew and documents that are tied to that event.

<h2>Quick start installation guide</h2>


To run our system, run these commands in a command window with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "git download page") installed. You also need [npm and node](https://nodejs.org/en/ "npm and node"). We have used node 13 for our project, and recommend you use the same. 

```javascript

git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/williaj/harmoni-team-7.git

cd harmoni-team-7/application/server
 
npm install
```

This will take some time.
```
npm start
```
This will start the server running on port 8080 on localhost of your machine.
```
cd ../client

npm install

npm start
```

Your development server will now start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000 "Your local machine").

And that's it! If you have any questions or bugs, please feel free to contact us.
